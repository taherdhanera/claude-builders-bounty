# Bounty #1 verification map

Maps each acceptance criterion to the exact command or artifact in this PR.

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| `/generate-changelog` or `bash changelog.sh` | `SKILL.md` (`name: generate-changelog`) + repo-root `changelog.sh` |
| Fetches commits since last git tag | Default range `${SINCE_TAG}..HEAD` in `changelog.sh` |
| Auto-categorizes Added / Fixed / Changed / Removed | `commit_type()` + section builders in `changelog.sh` |
| Breaking changes surfaced | `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE` subjects get a **Breaking** section |
| Append to existing changelog | `--append` prepends a release while preserving prior entries |
| Outputs formatted `CHANGELOG.md` | Keep a Changelog-style headers and bullet lists |
| Tested on a real repo (sample in PR) | `samples/CHANGELOG.sample.md` generated from this repo |
| README with setup in ≤3 steps | `README.md` Quick start (3 steps) |

## Commands

```bash
# Regression tests (63 checks)
bash skills/generate-changelog/tests/test_changelog.sh

# Verify the sample using its exact source history and the current generator
bash skills/generate-changelog/tests/verify_sample.sh

# Generate changelog for current repo (repo-root entrypoint)
bash changelog.sh

# Preview without writing a file
bash changelog.sh --preview

# Prepend a release to an existing changelog
bash changelog.sh --since v1.0.0 --version 1.1.0 --append
```

Expected test output ends with `Tests: 63 passed, 0 failed`.

Additional regression coverage: unknown commit categories require manual review, literal backslashes survive output, and shallow history is rejected without overwriting release notes. Sample source: 2fad474f5c999bd7188dfcc2c30745dd22dbcf28 (six non-merge commits); generated on 2026-09-08 with the updated classifier.

Git history command failures are tested in write, append, and preview modes; each must fail without modifying existing output or emitting a successful preview.

The tagged-topic regression asserts that automatic selection keeps the mainline release boundary and includes both mainline and topic commits. An explicit `--since topic-preview` still selects that ancestor. The pre-fix generator failed all three automatic-boundary assertions.
